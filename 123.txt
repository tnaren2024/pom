Here are **test scenarios** for the visible functionality in the updated screenshot:

### **Positive Test Scenarios**
1. Verify that the "Event Source" and "Event Type" are displayed correctly with relevant details.
2. Verify that the associated "Team Name" and "Email Distribution Group" are displayed as expected.
3. Verify that the "Rule Name" and other metadata (e.g., tags, event source ID) are displayed properly.
4. Verify that the "Attribute-level Access" section loads and displays accurate access type information.
5. Verify that the "I Agree" checkbox can be selected without issues.
6. Verify that clicking the "Submit" button successfully submits the access request when all details are correct.
7. Verify that the "Back" button navigates to the previous screen without data loss.
8. Verify that the "Cancel Request" button clears the current access request and navigates to the dashboard.

### **Negative Test Scenarios**
1. Verify that leaving the "I Agree" checkbox unselected disables the "Submit" button.
2. Verify that invalid data (e.g., corrupted event source or rule details) in the displayed fields prevents submission.
3. Verify that missing or incomplete mandatory fields (e.g., event source details) show appropriate error messages.
4. Verify the system's behavior when clicking "Submit" without an active internet connection.
5. Verify how the system handles a timeout during the submission process.
6. Verify that clicking "Cancel Request" without confirmation does not save any data.
7. Verify the application's behavior if the backend rejects the request due to validation errors.
8. Verify handling of duplicate entries in the "Event Source" or "Rule Name" fields.
9. Verify that the "Submit" button does not work if data integrity is compromised during navigation (e.g., skipping steps).
10. Verify that incorrect or unsupported access types in "Attribute-level Access" trigger appropriate warnings.Here are **test scenarios** for the visible functionality in the updated screenshot:
